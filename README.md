# roblox-rpc

**roblox-rpc** integrates Discord Rich Presence with the ROBLOX API to find the current game on ROBLOX you're playing.

### This is an alternative to [ro-presence](https://github.com/JiveOff/roPresence).
* ***Why?*** Because ro-presence goes overboard by reading from your [registry](https://github.com/JiveOff/roPresence/blob/master/lib/bloxauth.js) to retrieve your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie in order to function.


### How roblox-rpc does it.
* **roblox-rpc** uses [RoVer Verification](https://verify.eryn.io/) and soon [Bloxlink](https://blox.link/) through Discord to find out the account you're verified with and will utilise the ROBLOX API to find the games you're in.
